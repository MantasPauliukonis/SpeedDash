# SpeedDash
Bicycle speedometer project powered by Arduino.

I'm using Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V with 128x64 OLED SPI screen.

Also using two graphics libraries:

<br><a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306">Adafruit_SSD1306</a>

Unit has two speed sensors one for cadence and other for speed.

On the display you can see: speed, cadence (value and graph), and odometer.
